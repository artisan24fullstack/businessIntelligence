#### Data Modeling
- This part focuses on the technical aspects of data management:
  
```
* Relational modeling and denormalization: fundamental database concepts
* Dimensional modeling and data warehousing: approach for historical analysis
* Management and administration of database management systems (DBMS)
```

##### Data Centre, Data Warehouse, Data Mart
- Justification of denormalization
- Data Warehouse, Data Mart
- Maintaining relational modeling principles through denormalization
- Modeling according to user needs
- Semantics and maintainability
- Descendant projects and ancestor projects

##### Hierarchical modeling of dimensions
- Rules for constructing a star model
- Stars and snowflakes
- From star to OLAP cube
- Calculating volumes
- Anticipating functional evolutions

##### Modeling indicators
- Defining indicators by business area
- Aggregating indicators
